## Homework

Each week in this course you will complete a homework assignment. Each assignment should take you approximately 1-2 hours. You will write your homework in the C# programming language. The deliverable for each homework assignment will be a complete, zipped Visual Studio C# project that is ready to execute. 

Other than the first week of the course, many assignments will provide you with some code that you need to add on to or improve. Additionally, you are free to utilize code you have written for previous assignments as long as it is relevant to the current assignment. However, you **may not** use other students' code, even with permission - all code you submit for your assignments must be either provided in the assignment or **your own work**. 

Each week you will look at this README file in the `homework` folder of the weekly code repository. The README file will outline the assignment's requirements and expectations, and will provide a grading rubric to help you gauge your own performance. 

### Week 1 Assignment

This is the only week during which you will *not* receive any code, data or other files to get started with. But don't worry, this week's assignment is pretty simple!

2. Prompt the user to input a number at the command line.
3. For each of the following types, print out whether the user's input could be accurately and fully represented within that data type:

    * `short`
    * `int`
    * `long`
    * `float`
    * `double`
