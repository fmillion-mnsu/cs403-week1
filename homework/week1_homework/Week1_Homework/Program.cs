/*
 * This program is a starting point for your Week 1 homework.
 * I have given you the code for parsing and attempting to print a conversion to an int data type.
 * You need to do the same for the following data types:
 * 
 *   - byte
 *   - short
 *   - long
 *   - ushort
 *   - uint
 *   - ulong
 *   - float
 *   - double

// Using statements tell C# that you want access to certain namespaces in this code file.
// They are similar conceptually to Python "import" statements.

// "System" gives us many core functionalities like the Console object.
// It is technically not required for the latest .NET versions, but it does not hurt to
//   include it, and it will help reduce ambiguities.
using System;

// Namespaces help you organize your code objects into logical collections, and also help
//   prevent name collisions across multiple code libraries.

    // In C#, it is good practice to have a class for your program.
    // The class should contain a static method, with return type of either void or int,
    //   which will be the main entry point for your program.
    // The "string[] args" parameter is not required, but will be populated if you provide
    //   command line arguments to your program.

    // This is not strictly necessary in the latest C# / .NET versions, but it is still
    //   good practice to do this - it helps keep your code organized and makes it clear
    //   to the compiler and runtime where your entry point code is.
