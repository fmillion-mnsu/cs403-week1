# CS 403 - Topics in Programming Languages

## Minnesota State University, Mankato - Spring 2023 Block 2

*Instructor:* Flint Million ([flint.million@mnsu.edu](mailto:flint.million@mnsu.edu))

**Welcome!!** In this course you'll be learning about programming languages! The main language we will be using is C#, but many of the topics we cover will be applicable to other languages. It is one thing to learn how to write code in a specific programming language; it is another thing entirely to *understand computing and programming* at a fundamental level - this knowledge will enable you to pick up just about *any* new programming language rather quickly! It is my goal to empower you with this knowledge in this course!

Each week we will utilize these code repositories to share sample code with explanations as well as your homework assignments. You will submit your homework assignments via D2L - there are additional details about this in this week's homework folder.
